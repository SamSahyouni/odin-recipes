    <h2>Ungle George's Hummus</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite hummus recipes is a classic blend of creamy chickpeas, 
        tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, seasoned with a touch of cumin 
        and paprika. The result is a smooth and velvety texture with a rich, nutty 
        flavor that's both satisfying and irresistible. I love to garnish it with a
         drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley 
         for a burst of freshness. Whether paired with warm pita bread, crunchy vegetables,
        or spread on sandwiches, this homemade hummus never fails to delight with its vibrant
        taste and comforting simplicity.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chickpeas</li>
        <li>tahini</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Soak and cook the chickpeas</strong>
            <p><em>If using dry chickpeas allow extra time for soaking (overnight) and cooking (2 hours).</em></p>
            <p>Take 1 cup dry chickpeas and place it in a large bowl. Add plenty of water and soak overnight (chickpeas will expand in the bowl).</p>

            <p>When ready, drain chickpeas and place them in a medium-sized heavy cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil,
            then reduce heat and simmer for 1 ½ to 2 hours. You should end up with about 3 cups of cooked chickpeas.</p>

            <p><em>If using canned chickpeas, give them a quick 20 minute simmer in plenty of water to help soften them some more.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Peel the chickpeas</strong>
            <p>
                Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 ½ teaspoon baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. Take a handful of chickpeas and 
                rub under running water to remove the skins. Discard skins. Let the chickpeas cool completely before using.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Puree the chickpeas in a food processor</strong>
            <p>
                Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor that's fitted with a blade. Run the processor until the 
                chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like paste
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the rest and keep blending</strong>
            <p>
                While the food processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and 
                if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth 
                consistency. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or so before serving.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish</strong>
            <p>
                Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil. Add a few chickpeas 
                to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies 
                and some warm pita bread.
